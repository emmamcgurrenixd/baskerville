            <p>The role of a Graphic Designer in filmmaking is to create the visual experience that the viewer witnesses when watching a film. Every TV series, movies and even advertisement has at least one graphic designer working in the shadows. Not all of their work may be apparent and some may not even appear on screen. However, without the graphic designer, the movie would have no props, posters, patterns, lettering… and without all of these things a pitiful absence of visual aesthetics.</p>

            <p>The graphic designer has the opportunity to create another world, with elements that may not be completely exposed to the viewer, but are still of importance. Successful graphic design allows a film to create a new experience that you are unfamiliar with, whilst being authentic enough to make you feel as though the setting is a reality.</p>

        <h2>Part 2 - Examples of Graphic Design in film…</h2>
When we think about Graphic Design in the film industry, the main elements that we consider first are stereotypically the movie posters and maybe the chosen typography. Today however, we are going to realise that there is much more to the job than meets the fixated eye. 
The lead graphic designer chosen for a film begins by receiving a copy of the movie script. They will sit down with a highlighter and pen and outline all of the elements they and their team of designers are going to have to create. Every line may lead to something relevant for the scene to make sense, so they must be meticulous on their search for graphic opportunities. Some scenes may be what they refer to as, “graphic heavy”, such as office scenes or a toyshop setting. Others such as prison cells, may not contain as much design. The planning will begin with the designer looking for inspiration from real references, deeply researching the history and background, to help realise the correct aesthetic. The aesthetic is not only vital for the audience, but also the actors and directors. A realistic scene, with realistic props and appropriate design, will always allow the character to feel more comfortable and creative in their role. 

There are many marvellous examples of exceptional graphic design in the film industry. However one that always seems to stand out is the Harry Potter series. The creative duo behind the design of J.K Rowling’s wizardry world are Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima. The pair collaborate to operate from their studio MinaLima Design. MinaLima Studio, are responsible for the newspapers, tabloids, book covers and letters from seven out of the eight films. The tailor-made graphics include the use of vintage fonts, taken from old books and the Ministry of Magic official decrees riff off the lines and simple geometries of Constructivist poster design. An advert for the Quidditch World Cup incorporates retro graphics seemingly inspired by midcentury Olympics posters.

The designers gave Hogwarts a Gothic look and feel, to match the school’s gaudy architecture. Even though Harry Potter was set in modern day, an olden day aesthetic fitted the movie so well. This is depicted through many elements , my favourite being the four-story Weasley joke shop in Half-Blood Prince (2009), where their team spent nearly six months designing hundreds of bits of packaging to bulk out the shop. They were inspired by old, funny, Chinese food packaging which they altered to make the store feel like ‘the authentic brainchild of two eager and entrepreneurial teenage wizards’. Of course, the props, signs, newspapers, etc. are not at the forefront of the movies, but all of the subtle combinations of Art and Graphic Design in the movie creates a beautiful yet believable fantasy atmosphere, that stole the hearts of the world.
Annie Atkins

To those who have no knowledge or understanding of the arts, the creation of a successful film requires all but a provoking storyline, a talented cast and possibly a bag of popcorn. However, I think it is important that we note the importance of the role of graphic design when assembling of a movie. A lady who deserves credit for her successes in the film industry, is Annie Atkins. Annie Atkins is known for being the lead graphic designer on movie sets such as ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’, an iconic example of wonderful graphics. She has also designed for many more, including ‘Isle of Dogs’ and ‘The Boxtrolls’.

Born in Wales, with an Irish background, design is rooted in Atkins. Both of Annie’s parents came from creative design backgrounds. She was raised in a house full of design posters and big books of artwork making it inevitable, that she was born to create. Atkins grew up watching her father in his role as a Graphic Designer for a company called Hypnosis, where he designed record covers during the 70s. 

Atkins had the passion to be a designer. She states, “I remember feeling like I really wanted to be able to create something like that too – I wanted to be a designer, but I also wanted to be an artist because I wanted to make peculiar things.” She saw a clear pathway for her future and so she began studying Visual Communications in London before moving to Iceland for four years. Atkins then completed an MA in Film at UCD, enabling her to become a Graphic designer on film sets. Atkins first job in the film industry was on set of the series The Tudors, where she went on to receive recognition for her eye for detail by getting jobs on sets such as BoxTrolls, Penny Dreadful and Oscar award winning, Grand Budapest Hotel.

Quite often, graphic designers like Annie, work on period pieces, meaning they are set in the past. A lot of research is needed to replicate the exact style and presentation of things like building signage and newspapers. Annie Atkins collects inspiration, such as old stamps, stickers and postcards from different eras. She works both digitally and by hand, which is what I like most about her work. Whilst working on ‘The Tudors’, she stated how she could not understand why a graphic designer would be required to design on a series set when graphic design didn’t even exist. This is when she realised as the graphic designer she would have to interpret the role of the people who would have designed everything during that period  of time, hence she became a calligrapher, making things such as proclamations, a glazier creating stained glass windows along with a sculptor, for tombstones. Graphic design on a film set could be one of the most diverse jobs ever, you could almost say she is an actor in her own job.

Annie Atkins lives by the golden rule when designing for films, “If it was made by hand at the time, make it by hand now. If it was made by a machine at the time, make it by machine now.” She believes it helped to keep an authentic, realistic feel. Atkins also recommends starting all of your designs from scratch. With your own pencil and piece of paper you have the ability to capture the essence of the movie, through every aspect including typography and even pattern.
Often, being a graphic designer on a film set could be thought of as a thankless job, with many of the props and visionaries you have spent hours creating getting zero to minimum screen time. Graphic designers always tend to be at the bottom of the food chain of priority when it comes to the shooting of a film . A film is shot by location order, rather than story order, therefore props must be ready at hand, with at least 6 copies of each, for different takes. Each prop must also be identical, known as continuity.
This telegram seen above had to be recreated 30 times, with every single detail having to be identical, including the splashes of blood and creases in the paper. To be a graphic designer on set, I think that the word ‘Perfectionist’, may have to fall into an essential personality trait.  

A lot of thought and research goes into every prop. Hero props are the props which get the most focus. It still may only be a couple of seconds, but that is the graphic designers opportunity to showcase their highest quality work. The main prop in ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ is the escape map which occurs on the back of a parcel. (Should I discuss this in more detail?) These are the kinds of details that you have to create to make a fully realised world.


 Language is also a very important part of the graphics, therefore it is important to be extremely cautious with regards to spelling and punctuation. Whilst working on the grand Budapest Hotel, Annie Atkins made a spelling mistake… she spelt Patisserie incorrectly on the Mendl’s boxes. Before the mistake was spotted, quite a few boxes had already been shot….
Thousands of boxes had already been made and had to be edited. This shows how particular the attention to every detail must be, as well as the commitment of the designers to make the movie a success.


Conclusion 
Becoming a graphic designer on film sets is a job which takes a huge amount of skill, patience, creativity and also confidence. The quiet designer who works in the shadows, yet without them movies like The Grand Budapest Hotel or Harry Potter, would not be as successful as they are today. Not only would they become less pleasurable to watch, but life would be more difficult for the actors and directors. The graphic designer fills the spots in the film set that no one else thought to fill.
